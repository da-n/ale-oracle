        <h3>East India Pale Ale</h3>
        <h5>Brooklyn Brewery. 6.9% Abv.</h5>

        <p><strong>Brooklyn East India Pale Ale</strong> is inspired by the original East India Pale Ales brewed in England in the early 1800&rsquo;s for the troops in India. Everyday English ales were spoiling during shipment from London, around Africa&rsquo;s Cape of Good Hope, to Calcutta. Using extra malt and hops, British brewer George Hodgson developed an ale with the bitterness and strength to endure the long sea voyage, giving rise to a great beer style. Our East India Pale Ale is a deep golden beer brewed from British malt and a blend of hops featuring the choice East Kent Golding variety. It is traditionally dry-hopped for a bright aroma of hops, lemongrass, pine and citrus fruit, and has a robust bitterness, a warming malt palate and a clean hoppy finish. We think Hodgson would be rather pleased.</p>
